## What are demands?

- Direct requests or questions
    - eg 'put on shows', 'sit and wait', 'would you like a drink?'
- indirect demands
    - eg praise (leads to anxiety over future performance rather than positive reinforcement), uncertainty (need to know and feel in control of what's going on)
- demands within demands
    i e, smaller implied demands within demands (eg going to theatre implies be quiet and stay seated)
- plans
  - advance planning can lead to anxiety as time for the plan nears
  - intolerance of uncertainty can make spur of the moment decisions sources of anxiety
- 'I should" demands
    - eg getting u, washing, dressing, eating, sleeping etc
- Things we want to do!
    - eg hobbies, seeing friends,

## What is demand avoidance?

- not being able to do certain things at certain times, for yourself or others, and things we do in order to avoid demands
- _pathological_ refers to it being all-encompassing
  - avoding demands because they are demands, sometimes the expectation leads to a feeling of lack of control, which increases anxiety and panic
  - can be irrational, eg a dramatic reaction to a tiny request, or feeling hungry stopping someone being able to eat
- _avoidance_ can vary

## Avoidance approaches
- distraction (changing the subject or engaging in interesting conversation)
- procrastinating
- excusing yourself (giving explanations as to why you can’t comply)
- incapacitating yourself (saying ‘my legs don’t work’)
- withdrawing into role play or fantasy
- reducing meaningful conversation.

If these approaches don't work or aren't noticed by others, escalation to panic can be rapid as a lack of choices / options to retain control is felt. Meltdowns in PDA are best understood as being like panic attacks.

## Identyifying PDA
- often missed, misunderstood, or misdiagnosed
  - eg as Oppositional Defiant Disorder (ODD), Conduct Disorder (CD),Reactive Attachment Disorder (RAD), Personality Disorders or Developmental Trauma

## Helpful approaches
Conventional approaches are often ineffective and even counter-productive
- conventional examples: firm boundaries, the use of rewards, consequences and praise
- typical approaches recommended for autism: routine, structure and predictability

### Better for PDA:
- [low arousal](https://www.lowarousal.com/) approaches, which keep anxiety to a minimum and provide a sense of control
- aim to establish a partnership based on trust, flexibility,, careful use of language and balancing of demands


## How to help
- recognise what demands are, how they are avoided, and be aware of triggers
- accept the demand avoidance and work to avoid triggers
- work to reduce demands, and have demand-free time
- person-centred counselling, mindfulness or meditation
